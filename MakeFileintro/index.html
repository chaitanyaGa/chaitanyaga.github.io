so --- shared object compiled only files -c

#include "weather.h"  /// as it is not from /usr/include


gcc weather.so mainprog.c -o executbale.o -g


using several library
link external objects files 

libraris in system
/usr/include ------ all header/declaration for libraries
/usr/lib  ------ binaries/definations for library

2 ways to write it in gcc prompt:
gcc -lmath prog.c -o uiii -g3
gcc /usr/lib/libmath.so prog.c -o uiiii -g3
.a --- archive



modifying the library created by us, we need to compile library.
we can automate process of compilation  ----- use makefiles

gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -c libimage.c -o libimage.so
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra limage superimage.c -o superimage




automate build process  ---- makefile
importance of tab in makefile:


#Strcture of make file:
target(what you wish to produce): what is needed to do so
	How to produce that

	
	**************running program with makefile
launch: program
	./program
	
keywords in makefile:
all
